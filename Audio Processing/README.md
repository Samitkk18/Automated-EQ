So, I haven't added the data in the file since the dataset is like ~22 GBs. </br>
Now you don't have to be a blunderous fool and download the whole thing like I did. </br>
What you can do is go to the [SAVEE Dataset Website](http://kahlan.eps.surrey.ac.uk/savee/Data/) and Download these files from the`Zip` folder: `SAVEE_licence_agreement.txt` and `AudioData.zip`. </br>

Extract these files and store them in a `data` folder inside the `Audio Processing`. </br>
Now just run the python scripts!
